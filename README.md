# project2_planning_dijkstra

The input of the start and goal coordinates should be given as follows:
Enter x coordinate of starting point 
enter the value
Enter y coordinate of starting point 
enter the valaue
Enter x coordinate of goal point 
enter the value
Enter y coordinate of goal point 
enter the value

If the points lie in the obstacle space, it will ask again to input the goal and start coordinates
After giving the inputs, when the goal has been reached, "Goal has been reached" will be printed in the terminal.

Wait for a while, the window will open showing the visualization of the algorithm.
It takes some time for the algoritm to explore all the nodes before reaching the goal.
